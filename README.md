## How applying SOLID principles to React components
SOLID principles are a set of design principles that can help you create more maintainable, scalable, and robust software. 
They are especially useful when building React components. 
This repository with examples those will show you how to apply each of the SOLID principles to your React components.

## SOLID Principles
SOLID is an acronym that stands for:

1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each component should have only one reason to change.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Components should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
This means you should be able to extend a component's behavior without modifying its source code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. 
This ensures that components can be replaced with their subtypes without affecting the application's behavior.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Components should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. 
This means you should create small, specific interfaces for components rather than large, general ones.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.
In the context of React, this principle ensures high-level components should not directly depend on low-level components, but both should depend on a common abstraction.
In this case, “component” refers to any part of the application, whether it’s a React component, a function, a module, a class-based component, or a third-party library.
